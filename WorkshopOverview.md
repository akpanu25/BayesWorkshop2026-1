# Bayesian statistics in Sustainability Science, with a focus on Agrarian Societies and Ecosystem Services in the Lake Chad Basin

## Description

The workshop will consist of five in-person days from January 12 to 16, 2026, and 4 to 8 hours of online preparatory material on Bayesian statistical analysis prior to the in-person workshop in Abuja, using the freely-available R coding software. 

## Broad learning objectives

I. Participants will gain confidence and a set of tools for continued self-directed learning in computational skills.
II. Participants will develop an intuitive understanding of Bayesian data analysis and its applicability to real-world scenarios.
III. Participants will implement a Bayesian data analysis workflow with a real dataset.

## Pre-workshop materials

The purpose of the pre-workshop materials is to maximize the value of the in-person workshop days. By the end of the pre-workshop materials, participants will: 

1. Install the necessary software and packages on their computer.
2. Familiarize themselves with basics of R coding through practice exercises.
3. Practice a coding and analysis workflow that will serve them during the workshop and beyond.
4. Familiarize themselves with fundamental concepts and applications of Bayesian data analysis.

The pre-workshop materials will consist of self-guided activities including readings, videos, and exercises. Students will have two opportunities to meet virtually with instructors in January 2025. The first virtual session will be focused on troubleshooting issues with software installation, R coding, and other computational topics. The second virtual session will be focused on reviewing concepts of Bayesian data analysis. 
 
Before the in-person session, we will ask participants to complete a survey to assess their learning and evaluate their interests to help sort them into project groups.

## In-person Workshop
The in-person workshop will give students an opportunity to continue building their computational and analytical skills. All activities of the workshop will be organized around a group project in which they will implement a Bayesian data analysis workflow on a real dataset. 

### Bayesian analysis workflow steps

0. Set up project workflow.
	- Make a group github repository
	- Create an R project for your repository.
	- Create a directory structure.
	- Start a README file.

1. Get to know your study system.
	- Read descriptive and background materials provided.
	- Write an overview paragraph (who/what/where/when/why). 
2. Get to know your data.
	- Organize your data and documentation files.
	- Inspect metadata.
	- Examine the data structure using R.
	- Draw exploratory plots.
	- Write a setup script for your workflow.
3. Build a conceptual model of your study system.
	- Draw a diagram of all the components of the system and how they relate to each other.
	- 
4. Make a list of research questions you can ask about your system using your data.
5. Define one or more specific variables that address a research question.
6. Design a statistical model to produce those variables.
7. Test the statistical model against the conceptual model of your study system.
	- Prior predictive simulations.
8. Implement the statistical model to analyze and summarize inferences from your data.
9. Present your results and interpretation using graphics and words.
